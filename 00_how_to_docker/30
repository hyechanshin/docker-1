# 30. Increase the number of copies of the marines service up to twenty, because there’s never enough Marines to eliminate Zergs. (Remember to take a look at the tasks and logs of the service, you’ll see, it’s fun.)

docker service scale -d marines=20

# --detach , -d — Exit immediately instead of waiting for the service to converge.
