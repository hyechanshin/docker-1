# 14. Launch a wordpress container as a background task, just for fun. The container should be named lair, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port of the virtual machine, and it should be able to use the spawning-pool container as a database service. You can try to access lair on your machine via a web browser, with the IP address of the virtual machine as a URL. Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress website in two commands!

docker run -d --name lair -p 8080:80 --link spawning-pool:mysql wordpress

# https://docs.docker.com/network/links/
#Docker sets an <alias>_NAME environment variable for each target container listed in the --link parameter. For example, if a new container called web is linked to a database container called db via --link db:webdb
