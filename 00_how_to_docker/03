# 03. Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of your terminal, so that you can run the docker ps command without errors. You have to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed to use your shellâ€™s builtin to set these variables by hand.

eval $(docker-machine env Char)

#Using eval executes each of those export commands, instead of just writing them to the console, so it's a quick way of setting up your environment variables.
